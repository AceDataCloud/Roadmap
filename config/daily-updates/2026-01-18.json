      "summary": "This update resolves an issue with the ephone API where the balance was incorrectly displayed due to a change in the returned currency from RMB to USD. The calculation was updated to multiply the USD balance by 7 to convert it to RMB, ensuring accurate balance representation. Key changes were made in the balance.py file with minimal modifications, and thorough testing confirmed the fix."

This change reduces the function's complexity, cutting down the code from 26 lines to 18 while maintaining functionality. The update enhances performance and clarity in the balance fetching process."
